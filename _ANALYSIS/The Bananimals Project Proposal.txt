Problem Statement a.k.a Decompose The Ask
Throughout this project we will be exploring whether the increased population growth of cities is contributing to the increased number of breweries across the US. We will be looking at the average population growth of cities over time, average number of breweries over time, and income growth over time
Identify Data Sources
We will be using the US Census Data CSV files and BreweryDB’s API. The US Census Data will provide population per city overtime and BreweryDB’s API will provide a list of breweries and the city the breweries are located in.
Define Strategy and Metrics
Metrics
* Population growth over time
* Average income growth over time
* Rate of new brewery openings
* Number of breweries per city
* Population size vs the number of breweries
